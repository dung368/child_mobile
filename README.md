This application supports a few basic features: user register & login, HLS-stream camera add, camera remove.
User can toggle specific camera(s) as "Driver camera". After the driver camera no longer detects human for a set amount of time (modifiable through home page), other cameras are then checked for detection of children, if detections exist, the app then sends a local notification to user device.
